    I present to you my EBook Rental Website:
    <br><br>
    I made this project for a Web Programming Class, I worked on it in a group with Michael Tan, Brian Ramirez, Don Tran and Tomas Kaplan
    <br><br>
    The website allows users to purchase and upload ebooks!
    <br><br>
    The project uses HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
    <br><br>
    It includes a Login Page, Search Page, Book Display Page, Checkout Page and a Upload page.
    <br>
    Additionally it has an SQL database that stores user info, order info and book info.
    <br><br>
    It works by using session cookies to track users on the server.
    <br>
    I also put some thought into the security of the website by including prepared statements to prevent against SQL injections.
    <br><br>
    Overall the website is still in a prototype phase, it needs a better design, it doesn't have a payment system yet and some functions should be handled in Javascript to ease stress on the server.
    <br><br>
    I think its a very cool project which could facilitate ecommerce based on usergenerated content!
