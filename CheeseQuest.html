    I present to you Cheese Quest:
    <br><br>
    This was first game I made with Unity. The game is about navigating a maze as a mouse collecting cheese. The goal is to get all 3 cheese slices and reach the finish line with the fastest speed possible, but be careful, if you go too fast you may hit a deadly mousetrap!
    <br><br>
    How fast can you complete the maze?
