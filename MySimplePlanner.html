    I present to you MySimplePlanner Application:
    <br><br>
    This project is a planner application I made by myself. Before I would use physical paper planners to plan out my day-to-day tasks, but I didn't want to pay for them anymore, so I decided to make my own. Other online planners are very complicated, I wanted to make one that is simple so I can easily see everything I needed to do for the week.
    <br><br>
    - The planner is written in python and uses tkinter library for the UI.
    <br>
    - It displays 1 week at a time (with buttons to navigate between weeks)
    <br>
    - It automatically knows the week we are on and will open to that week
    <br>
    - It has a text box for each day which allows the user to input anything they want
    <br><br>
    This is one of my favorite projects, It is flexible and simple, and has helped me organize my life, I use it every day!
