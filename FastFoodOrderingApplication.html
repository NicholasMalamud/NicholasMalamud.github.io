    I made this project for a Software Engineering Class, I worked in a group with Ian Murphy and Neelakshi Soni
    <br><br>
    The project is a Fast Food Ordering Application that can be used in a kiosk to allow customers to make their own orders,
    <br><br>
    - The programming Language is Java
    <br>
    - It uses the Swing Library for the UI
    <br>
    - The UI is resizeable so it can be used on any screen size
    <br>
    - It has an SQL database that stores Menu Items and Receipts
    <br>
    - The database runs on a localhost server, but it can easily be modified to send info to a seperate server
    <br>
    - The application is built to be scalable with scrollable lists that allow for any amount of info
    <br>
    - It is a JAR executable so it can run on both windows and mac operating systems
    <br><br>
    I would say the hardest part of the project for me, was making the UI resizeable, the Swing library did not include a good way for resizing the elements.
    So I came up with a way to do it ourselves, the plan was to make the UI look nice on one screen size and record the size and position values for all the components then when the window size changes we change the values porportional to the screen change.
